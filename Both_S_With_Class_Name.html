            A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit”
             (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper 
             is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
